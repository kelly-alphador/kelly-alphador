# 👋 Hi, I’m @kelly-alphador

- 👀 I’m interested in **backend development**, especially with **.NET technologies**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **ASP.NET Core**, **Vue.js**, and **XUnit** for unit testing
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **backend APIs**, **web applications**, or any interesting open-source projects using **.NET** or **Vue.js**
- 📫 How to reach me: **kellyalphador@gmail.com**
- 😄 Pronouns: **he/him**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once built a full restaurant management system using Symfony and Vue.js just for fun — and now I want to bring that same energy to .NET!
